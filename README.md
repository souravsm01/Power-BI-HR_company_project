# Power-BI HR_company_project
Here I have made an interactive HR analytics dashboard of a company that analyzes their employee data.

The dashboard gives the information about:

1. Total count of employees

2. Attrition count and rate

3. Average monthly income of employees

4. Average age of employees

5. Average working year of employees in the company

6. Job satisfaction of employees by profession

    And many more data..

Since its an interactive dashboard, it shows changes in all the above mentioned parameters.

The csv files of the employee data has also been provided.
Thanks
